# Shipping-Rate-API

This is an application that gets the fare from using Gokada logistics for any location to any location within its accessibility.

Geocoding was also used to get geographical coordinates from human addresses.

Google Map API was integrated to achieve this.

Sendgrid API was also integrated to achieve sending emails of fare details to the requester's email address.

The application was connected to Firebase Realtime Database to save rates gotten from Gokada Logistics.

Endpoints are available for reading, updating and deleting the rate details from the Database.
